Excellent question — and yes, a Kendall-τ (mean) ≈ 0.47 is actually pretty good in this context.
Let’s unpack it clearly 👇

🧩 1. What Kendall-τ measures

Kendall’s τ (tau) is a rank correlation coefficient.
It measures how similarly two orderings rank the same set of items:

+1.0 → the predicted and true orders are identical

0.0 → no correlation (random ordering)

–1.0 → perfectly reversed order

For a warehouse-picking model, this means:

τ = 1.0 ⇒ model perfectly predicts the same pick sequence as experts

τ = 0.0 ⇒ model’s order is random relative to experts

τ = –1.0 ⇒ model predicts the exact opposite order of experts

📈 2. How to interpret τ ≈ 0.47

A mean Kendall-τ ≈ 0.47 means your model’s predicted pick sequences are moderately correlated with the expert (true) sequences — better than random, but not perfect.

Rough interpretation:

τ range	Correlation strength	Meaning in warehouse picking
0.0 – 0.2	Very weak	Predictions almost random
0.2 – 0.4	Weak → Moderate	Model picks roughly in the right direction, but not consistent
0.4 – 0.6	Moderate → Good	Model captures useful patterns (e.g., correct aisle flow, partial route match)
0.6 – 0.8	Strong	Model closely imitates expert sequence
0.8 – 1.0	Very strong / near perfect	Practically matches expert behavior

So τ = 0.47 ⇒ solid middle ground — the model is learning meaningful sequencing behavior (perhaps grouping picks by aisle or zone) but not yet reproducing full expert efficiency.

🧠 3. Practical meaning

In human terms:

“Roughly half of the relative order decisions between two items are predicted correctly.”

That means if you take every pair of items (A,B) within an order:

In about 74% of pairs (because τ ≈ 2 × p_correct – 1 ⇒ p_correct ≈ (τ+1)/2 ≈ 0.736),
the model correctly predicts which item should come before the other.

So you’re getting about 73–74% pairwise accuracy, which is decent for behavioral imitation.

🚀 4. How to improve τ further

If you want to push that higher:

Add contextual features

Spatial info: aisle → (x,y) coordinates, physical distance between bins

Temporal patterns: shift time, weekday, picker experience level

Order characteristics: number of lines, item type, zone density

Use a stronger ranker

Try LightGBM’s LGBMRanker or XGBoost Ranker (directly optimized for ranking).

Model sequence explicitly

Recurrent or transformer models can capture dependencies between consecutive picks (Markov-like dynamics).

Evaluate separately by order size

Small orders tend to yield higher τ; large, complex orders reveal weaknesses.

🧾 Summary
Metric	Meaning	Your value	Interpretation
Kendall-τ = 0.4725	Rank correlation (agreement between predicted & actual pick sequences)	~0.47	Moderate correlation — the model captures useful sequence structure but has room to grow
Pairwise accuracy ≈ 73%	Fraction of item pairs correctly ordered	0.73	Most, but not all, order pairs are predicted correctly
