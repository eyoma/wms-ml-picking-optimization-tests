# Markov Model for Warehouse Picking Optimization

## Overview
This document outlines a plan to build a Markov model to predict the most efficient picking sequence based on historical warehouse data.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Data Loading and Initial Exploration
- Load the data from the provided CSV file
- Perform initial exploration to understand its structure and content
- Analyze data quality and identify potential issues

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing values appropriately
- Convert data types as needed
- Structure the data into sequences suitable for the Markov model
- Clean and validate the picking sequence data

### 3. Markov Model Training
- Train a Markov model on the preprocessed picking sequence data
- Learn transition probabilities between different bin locations
- Optimize model parameters for best performance

### 4. Sequence Prediction
- Develop a method to use the trained Markov model
- Predict the most efficient picking sequence for new orders
- Implement prediction algorithms and heuristics

### 5. Model Evaluation *(Optional but Recommended)*
- Devise a strategy to evaluate model performance
- Compare predicted sequences with actual efficient sequences from experienced pickers
- Use simulation to validate model effectiveness
- Measure accuracy and efficiency improvements

### 6. Task Completion
- Summarize findings and the trained model
- Document how the model can be used to suggest efficient picking sequences
- Provide implementation guidelines for new users
